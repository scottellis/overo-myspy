A minimal driver to get started testing SPI devices with Gumstix Overos.

Based on the spidev.c driver under linux devices.

Does a few things different while trying to simplify. 
  
Some differences.
 
1. Uses the dynamic spi configuration functions spi_alloc_device()
   and spi_add_device(). Makes it easier to get started not having
   to modify a board file. 

   I am not sure how tested this dynamic interface is, but it's too 
   convenient to pass up. Nothing exploded yet.

   The driver still requires the spi master controller omap2_mcspi loaded 
   either static or dynamic. It will nag if not found. You don't need
   any of the ADS7846 code in board-overo.c though.
  
2. No classes for simplicity.

3. Full-duplex transfers. Only full-duplex, but that's only because
   that's what I'm working on now. Easy to change.
   
4. It's a char device with only open and write implemented. It's just
   for testing so it's where I'm putting all my test code.
     
5. You do have to create the /dev/myspy char device file after each boot.
   When the driver loads it will tell you the major,minor.
 
6. Lots of debug to the console.

7. Careful about calling spi_put_device on a spi_device after spi_alloc_device() 
   if for some reason you choose not to add it. There was some bad code in
   omap2_mcspi_cleanup(). I submitted a patch to the kernel mailing list. I'll
   probably send one over to the gumstix guys in the interim. 

8. If you don't have an build environment setup, use the source-me.txt to
   use the OE one. You might have to change the KERNELDIR var. After that
   the Makefile should just work.
